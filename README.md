# codingbasics
Let’s start with the basics, shall we?

This repo contains the code used in tutorials soon to be available at https://coderslife.io. Those tutorials will be complemented with video sessions that will explain, at a somewhat high level, how things work together.

## Folder `stdout`

This folder contains all the source code presented for the first session of Let’s start with the basics tutorials. There are two subfolders :

* `simple`: presents simple standard output examples;
* `formatted`: presents 3 types of formatting to use in the standard output.

You might realize that in C language, we use two different source files: one for **POSIX** systems (main.c) and another for **Windows** (`main_win.c`). Even though there are different ways to handle this, I want this first tutorial to be simple. We will present, in future tutorials, how we could handle this situation better.
